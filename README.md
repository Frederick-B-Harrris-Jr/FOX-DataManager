# FOX-DataManager
Food Object Cross-Reference Data Manager. 

The FOX-DM provides functionality to preview, extract, transform, and load data into a NoSQL or SQL-based DBMS. Data is primarily loaded into a NoSQL data format in PostgreSQL via JSONB for custom user queries to extract data as they see fit. Quantitative analyses were performed for image classification and segmentation tasks using multiple models on at least a single dataset in comparison to an enhanced dataset produced by FOX-DM. See dissertation for "A Comprehensive DBMS for Improving Data Collection and Analysis in Food Analysis: A Design Science Study" published February 2025 for more details.
